# Advertisement Success Prediction

worked with an advertising dataset, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. 
Created and compared different models that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

## Dataset

**WHAT I HAVE DONE**
- Discussed some major columns on which Advertisement Success depends.
- Handling outliers of diagnosis columns. As, it is very important because at last we're predicting success rate of Advertisement.
- Then I used different classification models to train the model.
- Use Correlation coefficients to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables.

**MODELS USED**
-  Logistic Regression
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-  Decission Tree
-  K Nearest Neighbour
-  Random  Classifier

**CONCLUSION**
By using Logistic Regression I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 89.33333333333333
    Accuracy of testing data: 90.8
 ``` 
 
 By using Support Vector Machine (SVM) I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 71.73333333333333
    Accuracy of testing data: 70.0
 ``` 
 
 By using K Nearest Neighbour I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 100.0
    Accuracy of testing data: 76.4
 ``` 
 
  By using Decission Tree I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 100.0
    Accuracy of testing data: 93.60000000000001
 ``` 
 
 By using Random  Classifier I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 100.0
    Accuracy of testing data: 94.8

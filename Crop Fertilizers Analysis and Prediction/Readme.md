**Crop Fertilizers Analysis and Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to analyse the different crop fettilizers and predict the type of fertilizers using the data.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gdabhishek/fertilizer-prediction).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Preparation
- Step 3: Data visualization
- Step 4: Data Training
- Step 5: Model Creation
- Step 6: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K Neighbors Classifier
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Logistic Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  100.00
 ``` 
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  80.15
 ``` 
- By using Ridge Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  79.73
 ``` 
- By using K Neighbors Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  59.49
 ``` 
- By using Lasso Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  71.39
 ``` 
- By using Random Forest Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  85.00
 ``` 
- By using Decision Tree Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  100.00
 ``` 
**Conclusion:**
- Conclusion: Accuracy of Regression models- Linear regression, rigde regression, Lasso Regression are around 70 to 80%.

- Whereas accuracy K Neighbors Classifier is around 59%.

- And the Accuracy of the logistic regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree are almost 100%, so they are efficient model among all.
